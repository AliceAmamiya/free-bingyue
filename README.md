# Free Bing-Yue
A fork of Gabriele Cirulli's [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

## About this game
I moded [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) at my high school time just for fun. [Play it here!](http://aliceamamiya.github.io/free-bingyue/)

## About this version
Since Ji Wei suddenly sent me my GitHub Pages link and told me that this "ancient relic" had been unearthed from the depths of Baidu Tieba, I decided to take a look at it from a ten-year-later perspective and make some "obfuscation adjustments."

Considering factors like portrait rights, this updated version replaced those photos with 2D drawings generated by algorithm. All images were created using "Hypic (Xingtu)". **The settings and characters in this work are entirely fictional and have no connection to real people, places, or events.**

I sincerely apologize for the previous unauthorized use of everyone's likeness in the story. I appreciate for your tolerance towards the reckless me of the past.

By the way, I also fixed a few issues on the page, so the game now automatically fits your device's screen, no more manual resizing needed.

The last update was five years ago (I wrote this piece of text in 2019), back when 2048 was one of the most popular games we played in the back row during breaks while preparing for college entrance exams. Hearing the news that Bingyue is active again reminded me that this little project almost got sealed away. Of course, younger folks probably have no idea who Bingyue is.

**Why free Bingyue?**

You might not like him because you’ve been on the receiving end of his tricks, or maybe he’s even smashed your phone into pieces. But he, like the 3D design (《三维设计》), Uncle Lian (「连叔」), and the grilled noodles at the school gate, is part of our collective memory of those three years in our small campus.

May life be kind to *the Mooncake King*.
May life be kind to every one of us.
